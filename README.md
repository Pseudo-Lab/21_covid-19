SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection - Identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs

Finally, after 3 months of brainstorming and innovating, we've come to the end of the Kaggle competition "SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection" which was based on Identifying and localizing COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs.
The Kaggle competition "SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection" was completed with 3 months of knowledge and engineering effort. The COVID-19 problem is a very important problem nowadays. Currently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or chest radiograph. However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias on chest radiographs, which makes it difficult to diagnose. We constructed the model using efficientnet, efficientnet-v2, YOLOv5, cascade r-cnn and centernet-v2. üéá
I am happy to be able to win the silver medal in this important and difficult competition. Thank you to [hwigeon](https://github.com/ohwi), [seongchae](https://github.com/powersht22), [WoongBae Yoon](https://github.com/xellnaga) and [Heonjin Ha](https://github.com/hihunjin) for the results we got from our team "[Kor]COVID-solver" members so well done. üëèüëèüëè
It wouldn't have been possible without my Z by HP Z4 workstation. Looking forward to competing in more such competitions! üè∞ - [Chanran Kim](https://github.com/seriousran)
